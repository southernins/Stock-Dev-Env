  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
  # config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network "public_network"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
     # vb.gui = true

     # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
     vb.memory = "2048"
  end

  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Define a Vagrant Push strategy for pushing to Atlas. Other push strategies
  # such as FTP and Heroku are also available. See the documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/push/atlas.html for more information.
  # config.push.define "atlas" do |push|
  #   push.app = "YOUR_ATLAS_USERNAME/YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME"
  # end

  # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
  # Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, and Docker are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
  # config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  #   sudo apt-get update
  #   sudo apt-get install -y apache2
  # SHELL
  
  # Run provision script
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "ops/bootstrap.sh"
  
  # Setup network connection between host/guest.
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, host: 80, guest: 80,  auto_correct: true
  
  # Run Drupal download script.
  #config.vm.provision :shell, path: "drupal.sh"
  
  
  ## This seems to not solve the problem....
  ## I still had to edite the rsolve.conf file to add google nameservers.
  ## add google open dns servers [8.8.8.8] and [8.8.4.4] to
  ## /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
  ## nameserver 8.8.8.8
  ## then run resolvconf -u to update configuration.
